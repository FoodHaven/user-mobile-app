This is the mobile-view application for Food Haven, a project under Ivy Hack that helps local small businesses reach out to potential customers. The merchant can release deals using the merchant website. The deal can be anything requiring a certain number of customers to sign up as a group and receive some discounts/reward/delivery. The merchant will then be notified of the orders. The customers will receive text messages once the group deal is confirmed.
