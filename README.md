Food Haven is an exploratory project aimed to help small businesses engage with their customers better in the post-COVID world.
This is the mobile-view application for Food Haven. The merchant can release deals using the merchant website. The deal can be anything requiring a certain number of customers to sign up as a group and receive some discounts/reward/delivery. The merchant will then be notified of the orders from the customers. The customers will receive text messages once the group deal is confirmed.
